Priority list:

order of items that flex-box chooses to set the size in each scenenrio.
MAX-WIDTH/MIN-WIDTH > FLEX-BASIS > WIDTH / height > CONTENT-WIDTH;

So say if the 
width:100px and flex-basis:200px is set, the flex basis will be considered since it is on the top of the list.

min-width is considered by the longest word in the sentence, and max-width is the size of the longest flex item.

so, 
flex-basis:200px;
and max-width:100px; is set the max-width will be considered bcoz of order.


flex-grow: and flex-shrink:

flex-basis:100px;
flex-grow:0;
flex-shrink:0;


flex-grow and flex-shrink can take 0 or 1 int values.

0 means off, 1 means on.
grow means it grows to completely fill up the entire width of the container.

flex-basis:100px;
flex-grow:1;
flex-shrink:1;
this means it will consiuem the wjole width of the flexbox and it will shrink to the smallest content of the flexbox.
if min-width is not used then this smallest word is considered, else the min-width is considered.



You can use shorthand to these 3 things.
flex-basis, flex-grow, flex-shrink
flex: 1 0 0; <grow> <shrink> <basis>

you can shorten it even further with flex:1 , flex:2, flex:3
