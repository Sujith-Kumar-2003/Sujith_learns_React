PSTI

1. Position

For example ==>

li{
color:red;
color:blue
}

The lowest one in the style sheet will be applied.

Here the color blue will be applied. FIrst the red will be applied then the color will be chnageed to blue.

2. Specificity

<li id = "first-id" class = "first-class" draggable = true>

li{color:blue}
.first-class{color:red}
li[draggable] {color:purple}
#first-id{ color:orange}

there can be a lot of element with same class, but id is unique, and there will be only 1 object with the same id.
element < class < attribute < id

SO Css with id is more prioritized

3. Type
External Internal Inline
The Inline will be prioritized over here. Eventhough you have multiple attributes, the inline will be more specific.

<link href = "styles.css" rel = "stylesheet">
<style> </style>
<h1 style = " "> Hello </h1>

4. Importance

color: red
color:green !important

Important keyword, so it will be applied, whatever the previous rule is. This will be applied.


<h1 class = "a-class another-class">Hello </h1>
.a-class{
color:green ;
}
.another-class{
color:blue;
}
since the another class is below the a-class in the file the another-class will be applied.


Another example
<html lang="en">
<head>
<style> #an-id{color:green}</style>
</head>
<body> <h1 id="an-id" style = "color:blue"> Hello </h1>
</body> </html>
