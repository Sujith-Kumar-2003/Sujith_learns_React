MEDIA queries
@media (max-width:600px){
CSS for screens below or equal to 600px wide.
}

You can also combine these media queries.
@media (min-width:600px) and (max-width:1200px){
this gives the style for screens between 600 and 1200pixles screens


You can aslo do this other way around: @media (max-width:600px) and (min-width:900px){
THIS WILL APPLY for screen sizes less than 600px and screens more than 900px

}
h1{color:green;}

}
