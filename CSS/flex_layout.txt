So layout, first thing i learned is ORDER

Order is a propoertuy that can be used inside a container,
but just remember this, higher the order, the lower it will be 
in the list.

.red{
    order:1
}

.green{
    order:4
}

first red will be placed beneath green.
Thats a fact. 

Next thing is called flex-wrap:

flex-wrap: nowrap
flex-wrap:wrap
flex-wrap:wrapreverse
These are the two properties, where wrap will wrap,but the wrap reverse
will wrap in the opposite direction, from the bottom left corner.

Now lets move on to the parent container properties:
justify-content: flex-start;
justify-content:flex-end;
justify-content:center;

justify-content: space-between; First and last elemtns are stuck to the end of eht screen
but the others are evenly space between

justify-content: space-around; Mkaes sure the first adn last have same space betwen all of then
lets say all elements int eh mid have 2 units of gap
the left and right has one unit gap from left and right;

justify-contnet: space-evenly; The thing is all spaces are even;

Align Items:
70vh height is 70% of the window that you are using 70% of the page;
the container that you are creating is 70% of the total height;

We need to set the height in order to show all the alignments for example;
height: 70vh;
align-items: flex-start;
align-items: flex-end;
align-items: center;
align-items: baseline;
align-items: stretch;

Also you can set the align-self to a child, to certain properties,
align-self: flex-start;
align-self: anything from align-items(flex-start, flex-end, center, stretch, baseline, etc.)

align-content: this only works when you set the flex-wrap to wrap.
if done with nowrap, it doesn't work.
Also it only applies to parent class.

You can also use the flex-flow which takes 2 values. The <flex-direction> and <flex-wrap>
