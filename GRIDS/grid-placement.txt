Lets learn how to place items in the grid.

grid-column: span 2

this spans the item to 2 cells

If you want to place an item somewhere in the grid, you can do this by:

grid-column-start: 2;
grid-column-end: 4;

Which spans it from 2-4 columns instead of 1 to 3.

You can also use -1 or -2 where -1 means the end of the column and the -2 means the column before the end.
This is useful to set the thing dynamically rather than static use.

1 means the left most line and -1 means the right most line.

NEXT THING is the order:
order:1;
the higher the order the more towards the last it will be placed.
usualyy everything has order of 0;
