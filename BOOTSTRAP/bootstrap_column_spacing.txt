Say if you want to evenly space out the column sizes in the container.
You can easily do that in bootstrap.
Bootstrap uses the 12=container thing.

So the space is evenly divieded into 12 columns.

so you can specify as col-2 and col-10 which will divide the whole
container space into 2 parts and 10 parts.

or col-2 col-4 col-6 to divide the contaienr into 3 parts.
you have to specify these names in the class name.

<div class = "container">
    <div class = "row">
        <div class="col-2"> Hello </div>
        <div class="col-4"> Hello </div>
        <div class="col-6"> Hello </div>
    </div>
</div>

THis is what i was talking about.
small-mobile, medium-ipad, large-laptop, xl - desktop, xxl - tv or more. xs - narrow screen and handheld.

FOR EXAmple, you can use col-sm-2, col-sm-4, col-sm-6.
which means col-small_device_into_2_col_size\]

Now lets get more complex-->
col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-lg-4
this means on small device it takes the whole size, in medium it takes 8 out of 12
in large devices it takes 4/12 the whole width.
